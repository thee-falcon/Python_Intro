# we import a math 'module', a module is like a store and the store has a many sections like, fruit,vegetables, cleaning materials...
# basicly that a simple example to understand the concept, but he is actualy like a separated file, inside this file has a scope of code (Functions)  
import math

x = 3.9

round = round(x) # this will round it to 4
print(round)

y = -3.9
abs = abs(y) # this will convert y to a positive integer
print(abs)

floor = math.floor(x) # will be floor it to become x = 3
print(floor)

ceil = math.ceil(x) # will be ceil it to become x = 4
print(ceil)
