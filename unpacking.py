# when creat a tuple, we normally assign values to it
# But in python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. this calles unpacking

coordinates = (1, 2 , 3)

# x = coordinates[0]
# y = coordinates[1]
# z = coordinates[2]

x, y, z = coordinates # this is a shorthand to achieve the same result of the top example initialize
                      # and this is unpacking in the python, and we can also use it with listes

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
